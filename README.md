I finally publish the source version of EpicWorkshop, I edited it a bit so that it is understandable and nobody gets too lost reading my code.
I didn't necessarily optimize Epic Workshop, that's why a lot of things are repeated often and some lines can be very weird.
I'm a newbie developer in all of this, I just have the knowledge and the solutions but not necessarily experience in optimization, so please be indulgent with my program,
thank you!

# Disclaimer
I know the code in EpicWorkshop is not optimized at all and the English of my comments is not perfect, so don't blame me for that.
